# 🔐Encrypto App

A simple Encrypt/Decrypt mobile app built with Flutter (frontend) and Python FastAPI (backend).
Users can enter text to encrypt, or ciphertext to decrypt, and save both locally for later use.

## 🔑Features

- Encryption: Enter plain text → get ciphertext.

- Decryption: Enter ciphertext → get plaintext.

- Local Save: Save plaintext and ciphertext in local SQLite DB.

- Simple UI: Two-button home screen (Encrypt / Decrypt).

- Backend API:

    /encrypt → returns ciphertext

    /decrypt → returns plaintext

- Deployment: Backend runs on Render.
